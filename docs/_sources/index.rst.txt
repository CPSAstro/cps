Welcome to CPSASTRO's documentation!
============================================

This is an in-development package for measuring integrated flux with background reduction and perform spectral cube analyses. The Quick start will have a brief example of the code function. To get an overview of available features, see Usage. The goal is to merge the functionality from asrtoquery and photutils apertures. Next stage of the code will include model comparison and more advanced spectral cube analyses routines.
